## Installation & Running Locally

### 1. Clone the project
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd smart-course-companion
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure Node.js is installed:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

Then install the project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Install backend dependencies too:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 3. Create the backend environment file
Inside the `backend` folder, create a file named `.env`.

You can copy the example file:
```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

The file should contain:
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://SCC:MmyImjE1jgo9QjUm@yetivault.gwjaghj.mongodb.net/?appName=yetivault
PORT=5000
```

### 4. Run the backend
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

You should see:
- `MongoDB connected`
- `Server running on http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### 5. Run the frontend
Open another terminal and run:
```bash
npm start
```
