## Installation & Running Locally

### 1. Clone or download the project
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd smart-course-companion
```

If you downloaded a zip, open the extracted project folder in Terminal instead.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure Node.js is installed:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

Then install the frontend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Install backend dependencies too:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 3. Create the backend environment file
Inside the `backend` folder, create a file named `.env`.

You can copy the example file:
```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

The file should contain:
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://soenteam:TD4A5bCQwp5Ngpnj@cluster0.q7pcywb.mongodb.net/?appName=Cluster0
PORT=5000
```

### 4. Run the backend
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
npm run server
```

You should see:
- `MongoDB connected`
- `Server running on http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### 5. Run the frontend
Open another terminal and run:
```bash
npm start
```

### 6. Demo login
Use:

- `student@test.com / 1234`
- `admin@test.com / 1234`

## Backend Notes

- The backend lives in `backend/server.js`
- API routes live in `backend/routes/users.js`
- Every teammate should use the same `backend/.env` values before testing PRs
